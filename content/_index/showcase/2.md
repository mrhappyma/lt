Robeab used to live off the cost of Portland, Maine, in the wonderful underwater land of Cabbagetopia, but things went slightly wrong when she tried to fly the CabbageCopter over the city, and forgot to read the manuel. There was a horrible accident involving a lot of cheese, a large turnip, and a few bits of spinach, which caused the CabbageCopter to crash, and Robeab to break her tail. Since her tail is broken, Robeab can't swim very fast, so she had to leave Cabbagetopia. She moved to LMS with all of her felt monster friends, and now there all living happily ever after, and eating way to much cheese.
